              The Tago platform is a closed-loop environment where users can
              exchange digital cash. TagoCash operates the same way real world
              cash does. Within TagoCash wallet, users can instantly give cash
              money to friends, family and vendors. At any time, users can move
              their cash out of the TagoCash wallet by transferring it to their
              own bank account, mobile money account or by picking it up cash at
              a MoneyGram store.
